README file for automated tests

OVERVIEW


The automated test suite contains the following:

* The tests as .c files in the tests/ directory
* A Makefile in the tests/ directory which compiles all tests; the results
  are placed in the build/ directory
* A shell script (linux_all) that compiles and runs the tests
* The file 'output' containing the results of the shell script


All test files produce no relevant output on stdout. However, libraries used
by the tests may do so (notably out own tcp lib with printf statements).
All relevent output by the tests is written to stderr, so it can be easily
captured.

If a test finishes successfully, no output is written to stderr and an exit
value of 0 is returned.
If a test finishes unsuccessfully, relevant messages are written to stderr
and an exit value of 1 is returned.


The shell script runs executes the Makefile in the tests/ directory. After
that, all compiled tests are in the build/ directory. Now it executes all
files in that directory, capturing its output on stderr. Together with some
info on the name of the test and date/time, this output is written to the
'output' file.

To be sure no floating ethernet packets from the previous test will influence
the next test, the shell script sleeps for 0.2 seconds between every test.



ADDING A TEST

To add a test, create the .c file for it in the tests/ directory and include
the compiling directives for it in the Makefile. That's all.



RUNNING THE TESTS

Just run the shell script 'linux_all'. It prints the results, which are also
stored in the 'output' file. If you don't see any meaningful messages printed,
there's a good chance all tests have passed.
